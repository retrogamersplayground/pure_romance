                <h1>About Pure Romance</h1>
                <p>     Founder & Chairwoman Patty Brisben started Pure Romance from the basement of her suburban Ohio home in 1993. Using the latest sexual health education, the best in must-have beauty products, and the hottest bedroom accessories, Patty empowered, educated, and entertained the women at her parties—helping them fulfill their desires while offering them the chance to own their own business and achieve their dreams exactly the way she did.</p>

                <p>     Today, we’re still all about empowering, educating, and entertaining women—the only difference? We’re doing it on a much larger scale than we ever could have imagined. As Pure Romance continued to grow, Patty was joined by her son, CEO & President Chris Cicchinelli, in 2000. Together, they’ve transformed Pure Romance into a $150 million company with 30,000 active Consultants all over the world. Those Consultants, located in the United States, South Africa, Canada, Puerto Rico, New Zealand, and Australia, all inspire women to enhance their intimate lives, take charge of their sexual health, and just maybe, take a leap and start a life-changing career.</p>

                <h1>Giving Back</h1>
                <p>    At its core, Pure Romance is a company that strives to improve the lives of women. Through talking to thousands of women each year, Patty realized the crucial need for more education, research, and community awareness about women’s sexual health, something that’s essential to every woman’s wellbeing. To respond to that need, in 2005, Patty established the Patty Brisben Foundation for Women’s Sexual Health. This nonprofit organization funds clinical research and education for women’s sexual health, aiming to raise awareness about these sensitive subjects while working with health care providers to help them improve the quality of life for women everywhere.</p>
