                <h1>About Rhonda</h1>
                
               <p> Meet your Consultant!  Hey girls!  My name is Rhonda Bingham and I have been a consultant with pure romance since 2014. I'm located in Nicholasville Kentucky but I do travel for parties and fun so don't be afraid to hit me up!</p>

 <p>I have built my business with pure romance while also working a full-time 40 hours per week job and being a wife mom of three.  My kids were in elementary school and middle school when I started my business.</p>

<p> I have completed several leadership trainings with the company and have earned several trips and cash bonuses, among other perks.  As of 2015, Pure Romance has helped pay my portion of the bills in the household so that my income from my day job could be used to pay off debt. I'm currently on target to be debt-free by 2020. Please know that you can feel confident that when you book a party with Rhonda B, you're going to get a knowledgeable and experienced consultant who knows how to bring the fun and excitement to your next girls night.</p>

 <p>I am currently in the process of obtaining my Sexual Health educator certificate which is administered through Indiana University.</p>
 
<p>Feel free to send me any questions or concerns!  I'm here to help you, whether it's a sexual health question, product question, or to help plan your next girls night or other special night!</p>

<p>I can't wait to see you at my next party!</p>

                <h1>About Pure Romance</h1>
                <div class="hide">
                <p>     Founder & Chairwoman Patty Brisben started Pure Romance from the basement of her suburban Ohio home in 1993. Using the latest sexual health education, the best in must-have beauty products, and the hottest bedroom accessories, Patty empowered, educated, and entertained the women at her parties. Patty helped them fulfill their desires while offering them the chance to own their own business and achieve their dreams exactly the way she did.</p>

                <p>     Today, we are still all about empowering, educating, and entertaining women. What is the only difference? We are doing it on a much larger scale than we ever could have imagined. As Pure Romance continued to grow, Patty was joined by her son, CEO & President Chris Cicchinelli, in 2000. Together, they have transformed Pure Romance into a $150 million company with 30,000 active Consultants all over the world. Those Consultants, located in the United States, South Africa, Canada, Puerto Rico, New Zealand, and Australia, all inspire women to enhance their intimate lives, take charge of their sexual health, and just maybe, take a leap and start a life-changing career.</p>

                <div class="hide">
                <p>    At its core, Pure Romance is a company that strives to improve the lives of women. Through talking to thousands of women each year, Patty realized the crucial need for more education, research, and community awareness about the sexual health women, something that is essential to the wellbeing of every woman. To respond to that need, in 2005, Patty established the Patty Brisben Foundation for Women's Sexual Health. This nonprofit organization funds clinical research and education for the sexual health of women, aiming to raise awareness about these sensitive subjects while working with health care providers to help them improve the quality of life for women everywhere.</p>
